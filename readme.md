//Every method has its own space inside the stack and every instance variables has their own space inside the heap memory 

// We can't use non-static variables inside the static methods but we can use it by using the object references.

// The default value of the string is null because it's an object 

// Every method inside the interface is public abstract by default
// All the variables inside the interface is by default static and final

// switch also supports enums!!!

// Annotations are used to tell the compiler about your intention (eg:- @override keyword)

// Lamda expressions only works with the Functional Interface because it contains only one method and lamda expression knows which method to implement.
